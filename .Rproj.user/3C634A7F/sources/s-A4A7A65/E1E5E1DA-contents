I am a PhD Candidate of Political Science at Duke University. My research focuses on business-state relations, bureaucracy, good governance, and authoritarian politics with a regional interest in China. Methodologically, I am interested in the "Big Data" analysis of state-business relations. For my dissertation and other research projects, I develop automated methods for collecting and matching extensive administrative data and create two original databases: the Chinese Revolving-Door Officials Database and the Chinese Public-Private Partnership Database. 

My research has been funded by institutions including National Science Foundation, Google Cloud Platform, the Chiang Ching-Kuo Foundation, and other research grants.
