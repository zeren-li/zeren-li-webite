I am a Ph.D. Candidate in the Department of Political Science at Duke University. My research focuses on state-business relations, good gorvernance, bureaucracy, authoritarian politics with a regional interest in China. My dissertation analyzes the pattern, formation, and economic outcome of the political-business revolving door in China. I empirically test the theory using various methods including natural language processing, survey experiment, and qualitative intervews.

My research is supported by Google, the Chiang Ching-Kuo Foundation and various other research grants.
