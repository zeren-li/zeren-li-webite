subtitle = "Institutionalized Rent-Seeking: The Political-Business Revolving Door in China"

+++

Does the political-business revolving door, a phenomenon where retired public officials take lucrative positions in the private sector, emerge in non-democracies? If so, when, how, and why? My dissertation proposes a theoretical framework for understanding the emergence of revolving-door officials in authoritarian regimes and tests the theory through rigorous inquiry into firms in China. Scholars contend that firms enter the political marketplace primarily through bribery or by entrepreneurs running for public office in a weak institutional context. My dissertation challenges this conventional understanding by arguing that revolving-door channels become a dominant means of rent-seeking when the within-government career opportunities are rare for public officials and the private sector is profitable.
