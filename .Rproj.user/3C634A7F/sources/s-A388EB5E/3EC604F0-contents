I am a PhD Candidate of Political Science at Duke University. My research focuses on business-state relations, bureaucracy, good governance, and authoritarian politics with a regional interest in China. Methodologically, I am interested in the "Big Data" analysis of state-business relations. For my dissertation and other research projects, I develop automated methods for collecting and matching extensive administrative data and create two original databases: the Chinese Revolving-Door Officials Database and the Chinese Public-Private Partnership Database. 

My research has been funded by institutions including [National Science Foundation](https://www.apsanet.org/PROGRAMS/Doctoral-Dissertation-Research-Improvement-Grants), [Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com/), [Chiang Ching-Kuo Foundation](http://cckf.org/en/news/2020060103), and other research grants.
