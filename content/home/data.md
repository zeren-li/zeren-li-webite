I plan to construct and maintain the Chinese Revolving-Door Officials Database that contains extensive demographic and career information of over 10, 000 government officials who serve on the board of all Chinese publicly listed firms since the 2000s. The database includes: 1) compensation information for revolving-door officials, including salary, allowance, and stock shares; 2) standardized career experience information; 3) relational database of their political network.
