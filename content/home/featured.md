Does the political-business revolving door, a phenomenon where retired public officials take lucrative positions in the private sector, emerge in non-democracies? If so, when, how, and why? In this dissertation, I propose a theoretical framework for understanding the emergence of revolving- door officials in authoritarian regimes and then test the theory through detailed, rigorous inquiry into the context of firms in China.
