I am a Postdoctoral Associate in the [Leitner Program of Political Economy, MacMillan Center, Yale University](https://leitner.yale.edu/). My research focuses on business-government relations, bureaucracy, good governance, and authoritarian politics with a regional interest in China. Methodologically, I am interested in the "Big Data" analysis of state-business relations. For my dissertation and other research projects, I develop automated methods for collecting and matching extensive administrative data and create two original databases: the Chinese Revolving-Door Officials Database and the Chinese Public-Private Partnership Database. 

My research has been funded by institutions including [National Science Foundation](https://politicalsciencenow.com/meet-zeren-li-2020-apsa-doctoral-dissertation-research-improvement-grantee/), [Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com/), [Chiang Ching-Kuo Foundation](http://cckf.org/en/news/2020060103), and other research grants.
