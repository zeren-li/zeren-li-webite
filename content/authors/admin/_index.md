I am a Postdoctoral Associate in the [Leitner Program of Political Economy, MacMillan Center, Yale University](https://leitner.yale.edu/). My research focuses on **business-government relations, bureaucracy, good governance, and authoritarian politics**, with a particular interest in China. Methodologically, I am interested in the "Big Data" analysis of business and politics. For my dissertation and other research projects, I develop automated methods for collecting and matching extensive administrative data, creating two original databases: the Chinese Revolving-Door Officials Database and the Chinese Public-Private Partnership Database. 

My research has been published and is forthcoming in [*British Journal of Political Science*](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/british-journal-of-political-science), [*Journal of Politics*](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3839170), [*Journal of Economic Behavior and Organization*](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167268123000987?utm_campaign=STMJ_AUTH_SERV_PUBLISHED&utm_medium=email&utm_acid=248459168&SIS_ID=&dgcid=STMJ_AUTH_SERV_PUBLISHED&CMX_ID=&utm_in=DM368176&utm_source=AC_),
 [*The China Quarterly*](https://www.dropbox.com/s/fnk9xi11ssejcwm/Markets_Under_Mao.pdf?dl=0) and other journals. My work has been featured by [*Financial Times*](https://www.ft.com/search?q=zeren+li), [*CNBC*](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/08/19/lobbying-china-firms-cant-influence-government-like-us-companies-do.html), [*The Wire China*](https://www.thewirechina.com/2023/01/29/chinese-entrepreneurs/), and [*The Guardian*](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/apr/19/unsafe-at-the-top-chinas-anti-graft-drive-targets-billionaires-and-bankers).

I earned my PhD in Political Science from [Duke University](https://www.duke.edu/). Prior to my time at Duke, I obtained my bachelor's degree from [Fudan University](https://www.fudan.edu.cn/en/) and completed my MPhil at [Hong Kong University of Science and Technology](https://www.ust.hk/).

My research has received funding from various institutions, including the [National Science Foundation](https://politicalsciencenow.com/meet-zeren-li-2020-apsa-doctoral-dissertation-research-improvement-grantee/), [Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com/), [Chiang Ching-Kuo Foundation](http://cckf.org/en/news/2020060103), and others.
